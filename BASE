BASE used for
BASE used in the value expression only.
1. When we don't want to overwrite the existing values of the internal tables, we use BASE in value expressions.
2. The values of the BASE table act as a initial values for the target table and after that the new values are inserted to the internal table.
3. It is very useful in loops when we want to append the rows to the internal table using value expressions.

4. it seems to works as "APPEND LINES OF <ITAB1> to <ITAB2>.

BASE EX:

types : begin of ty_test,
          a type i,
          b type i,
        end of ty_test,

data lt_Test type table of ty_test.

lt_test = value #( ( a =1 b =2 ) ).

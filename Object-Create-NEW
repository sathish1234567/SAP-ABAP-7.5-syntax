Before ABAP 7.4 to create the object, we used the key word as "CREATE OBJECT"
After 7.4 to create the object- Key word- "NEW"

class lcl defintion.
public section.
data : gv_i type i.
  methods : constructor importing p1 type i.
            display.
endclass.

class lcl implementation.
    method constructor.
        gv_i = p1.
    endmethod.
    method display.
        write :/ gv_i.
    endmethod.
endclass.

Ex:
    NEW lcl( )->display( ). --> here object created along with display() method also called.
    DATA(lo_ref) = NEW lcl( ). --> object created, later called the display method using the object
    IF lo_ref IS BOUND.
      WRITE |object created|.
    ENDIF.

or 

    DATA lo_ref TYPE REF TO lcl.
    lo_ref = new #( ).


Pass the values to the object using new syntax.
    DATA lo_ref TYPE REF TO lcl.
    lo_ref = new #( p1 = 1 ).
    lo_Ref->display( ).

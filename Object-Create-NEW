Before ABAP 7.4 to create the object, we used the key word as "CREATE OBJECT"
After 7.4 to create the object- Key word- "NEW"

Ex:
    NEW lcl( )->display( ). --> here object created along with display() method also called.
    DATA(lo_ref) = NEW lcl( ). --> object created, later called the display method using the object
    IF lo_ref IS BOUND.
      WRITE |object created|.
    ENDIF.

or 

    DATA lo_ref TYPE REF TO lcl.
    lo_ref = new #( ).
